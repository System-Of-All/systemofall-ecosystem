# Domains Layer

The Domains layer defines the operational and thematic areas in which the
System Of All ecosystem applies its principles, entities, and execution
frameworks.

Domains represent real-world sectors, institutional fields, and strategic
areas of activity governed by The One Core and coordinated through the
ecosystem structure.

## Purpose of Domains
- Segment the ecosystem into clearly defined areas of application
- Enable structured expansion across industries and institutions
- Provide alignment between entities, governance, and execution
- Support cross-domain coordination under a unified architecture

## Example Domain Categories
- Health & Life Sciences
- Space & Advanced Research
- Defense & Security Infrastructure
- Finance & Digital Assets
- Energy & Environment
- Education & Knowledge Systems
- Governance & Public Systems
- Technology & AI Infrastructure
- Philanthropy & Humanitarian Action

## Relationship to Other Layers
- **The One Core** defines the governing principles
- **Entities** operate within and across domains
- **Governance** establishes decision authority per domain
- **Execution** delivers outcomes within each domain
- **Interfaces** connect domains to one another

This layer defines *where* the System Of All operates.
