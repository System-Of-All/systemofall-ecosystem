# Governance Layer

The Governance layer defines how authority, decision-making, oversight, and enforcement
operate within the System Of All ecosystem.

This layer translates the principles and constraints defined in **The One Core**
into executable governance structures across entities, domains, and initiatives.

---

## Purpose of Governance

The Governance layer exists to:

- Ensure alignment with The One Core and The One Law
- Define decision-making authority and responsibility
- Establish oversight, compliance, and accountability mechanisms
- Coordinate actions across domains and entities
- Prevent structural drift, capture, or fragmentation of the ecosystem

---

## Scope

Governance applies to:

- Ecosystem-wide policies and rules
- Domain-level governance frameworks
- Entity authorization, roles, and mandates
- Strategic approvals and escalations
- Conflict resolution and enforcement

This layer does **not** define ideology, philosophy, or core principles.
Those are defined exclusively in **The One Core**.

---

## Governance Hierarchy

1. **The One Core**
   - Source of law, constraints, and architectural principles

2. **Ecosystem Governance**
   - Interprets and applies core principles at system scale

3. **Domain Governance**
   - Applies governance within specific industries or sectors

4. **Entity Governance**
   - Operational governance for individual entities and initiatives

---

## Key Governance Functions

- Policy definition and validation
- Authorization of entities and initiatives
- Oversight and audit mechanisms
- Risk management and escalation
- Enforcement of alignment and compliance

---

## Relationship to Other Layers

- **Entities**: Governance defines legitimacy, roles, and authority
- **Domains**: Governance coordinates cross-domain activity
- **Execution**: Governance constrains and validates execution paths
- **Token & Incentives**: Governance sets rules; tokens do not govern governance

---

## Evolution

The Governance layer is designed to evolve as the ecosystem expands,
while remaining strictly constrained by The One Core.

Changes to governance structures must never contradict
core principles, law, or systemic constraints.

---

## Status

This document establishes the initial Governance layer definition.
Detailed governance mechanisms will be introduced incrementally
as the ecosystem matures.
