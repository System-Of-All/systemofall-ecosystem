# Entities

## Definition

In the System Of All Ecosystem, an **Entity** is any formally recognized unit operating under the governance and architectural principles of **The ONE Core**.

An Entity may be organizational, technical, legal, institutional, or conceptual, provided it meets requirements for structural definition, responsibility, and traceability.

Entities are the **primary building blocks** of the ecosystem.

## Purpose of Entities

Entities exist to:

- Execute specific missions and functions within the ecosystem
- Operate within clearly defined scope and accountability
- Maintain alignment with The ONE Core principles
- Enable modular, scalable, and auditable ecosystem growth

Each entity is autonomous in execution, but **not independent in principle**.

## Entity Classification

### 1) Organizational Entities
Example: System Of All LLC, The One Legacy Foundation

### 2) Technical Entities
Example: SALL Token, SALL Multi-Sig, SALL Mining, System Of All Story

### 3) Governance Entities
Policies, controls, compliance, and review frameworks

### 4) Program Entities
Initiatives, research programs, and implementation tracks

## Minimum Entity Requirements

Each Entity must define:

1. **Identity** (name, owner, role)
2. **Scope** (mission boundary)
3. **Responsibilities** (deliverables and obligations)
4. **Interfaces** (dependencies and integration points)
5. **Controls** (security, compliance, risk controls)
6. **Traceability** (versioning, documentation, audit trail)

---

## Governance Rule

No Entity may operate outside The ONE Core governance model.  
All Entity-level decisions must remain traceable to ecosystem-level principles and controls.
