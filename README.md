# System Of All – Ecosystem

This repository defines the **System Of All ecosystem**: the company-wide organizational and execution structure through which the principles and architecture defined in **The One Core** are applied across industries, institutions, and initiatives.

## Relationship to The One Core

The System Of All ecosystem operates **under** the global agenda architecture and principles defined in the `systemofall-the-one-core` repository.

This repository does **not** redefine The ONE Law, the global agenda, or core architecture.  
It documents how execution, coordination, and organizational structure are realized at the ecosystem level.

## Ecosystem Scope

The System Of All ecosystem encompasses:
- Organizational entities and governance structures
- Industry domains (health, defense, space, finance, infrastructure, education, culture)
- Platforms and execution layers
- Philanthropic and institutional coordination
- Interfaces with global organizations and agencies

## Execution Layers

Execution mechanisms—including platforms, infrastructure, and coordination tools—operate within this ecosystem as **subordinate components**.

Specific implementations (such as digital platforms or utility tokens) are documented in their respective repositories and reference this ecosystem, but do not define it.

## Status

This repository is **structural and descriptive**.

It defines scope, relationships, and organizational context.  
It does not contain implementations, protocols, or product-specific documentation.
